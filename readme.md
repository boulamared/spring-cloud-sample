# Spring Cloud Sample Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Spring Cloud Sample Project! This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of various Spring Cloud concepts and implementations. Whether you're new to cloud-native development or looking to enhance your skills, this project provides examples and implementations for key Spring Cloud components.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (Optional for Docker-based services)

## Modules

The project is structured into several modules, each focusing on a specific Spring Cloud concept. Here's an overview of the modules:

1. **[config-service](/config-service):** Demonstrates Spring Cloud Config for externalized configuration.
2. **[discovery-service](/discovery-service):** Illustrates service registration and discovery using Eureka.
3. **[gateway-service](/gateway-service):** Implements an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway.
4. **[circuit-breaker-service](/circuit-breaker-service):** Introduces resilience patterns with Hystrix for circuit breaking.
5. **[feign-client](/feign-client):** Shows declarative REST client communication using Feign.
6. **[stream-processing](/stream-processing):** Implements event-driven microservices communication using Spring Cloud Stream.

## Running the Project

1. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

2. **Run Services:**
    - Each module may have its own set of instructions for running. Refer to the respective module's README for detailed steps.

3. **Accessing Services:**
    - After starting the services, you can access them based on their URLs and ports.
    - For example, the Eureka Dashboard can be accessed at [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761).
